This repository contains the contents of my undergraduate thesis: a machine learning model to generate jazz improvisation. By downloading the repository, you should be able to generate your own improvisations using the model in the 'outputs' folder and the vocabulary files in the 'vocab_files folder (once you have changed the file paths to work in your system).

I also included my processed dataset, which was derived from the Filosax data set:

I cannot include the Filosax data set in its original form, since it utilizes commercial backing tracks. If you would like to get the Filosax data set for yourself, please follow the instructions in the paper to request access. The 'jazz_data' file should be enough to train model from scratch, however.
